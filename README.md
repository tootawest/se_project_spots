## Intro

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. it was created using HTML and CSS, bases on a design brief from Figma. This project has shown the how to use and navigate Figma, an actual website development program. It has helped in my understanding of what is to be expected from me and has given me an understanding of what i could expect when actually working in the field.

## Plans for improving the project

i would change the background color. It does not stand out at all. I would change it to a more engaging color that pops out at the website visitor and draws them into the page to read more about whats going on.

Most peoples attention apan is not big enough to want ot do alot of reading, therefore i would use the first three lines that can be viewed as the attention grabber instead of beginning with who they where it would be a quick line telling what made them famous/ known.
